##  _**Results and Conclusion:**_

- After analyzing the data and applying different models, we can conclude that the Random Forest model is the best model for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. 

- The model has an accuracy score of 0.83, which is the highest among all the models. 

- The `Survived` column is assumed to be binary where 1 represents survival and 0 represents non-survival.

- Plots created above gives us a clear visual representation of the number of passengers who survived versus those who did not.

- The model predicts that 152 passengers survived and 266 passengers did not survive.

- The model predicts that 36% of the passengers survived and 64% did not survive.

- The model can be further improved by using different techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble learning.

- These techniques may refine the model, potentially increasing its accuracy and making it an even more reliable tool for predicting survival outcomes.
